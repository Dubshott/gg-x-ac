# P4 Slackbots Merchandise Store

The APCO x GG merch website was designed to display a variety of different clothing. 
Our goal with this is to create a well put together ecommerce website that looks 
very appealing and welcoming. We will back this up by creating our own clothing designed
by yours truly. The website will have different sizes and colors to choose from. 

# Future Plans
Future things we want to add to the website is add more types of items availible. 
Things like hats, beanies, pants, etc...

We also want to make the website actually allow payment options and make it secure.

We also want to try to use variables to actually save the things that the user buys so they can see the things that they have purchased in the cart.

# Features
This website has TONS of features. 

When you first come into the website, you will see this loading screen that looks like the background is fading out then back in. This is the animation effects that we added. Once you click the GG X APCO image, you will be redirected into the home page.
- The cool thing about this is that we were able to use animations to make the website look really epic. 

Once you are in the home page you can see all the cool things we used. 
1. We used bootstrap for the navigation bar
2. Used images inside to show the image of the product
3. Made a footer at the bottom that gives social links to both of our things. 
4. The CSS we used to make gradients and to make the website look super cool.

Now try clicking the one of the merch options. 
You will be redirected to its own page. You will see a huge image of the product. To the right of it, you will see the name of the product, reviews, description, sizing, and Add to Cart option.
- A cool feature we have in this is the add to cart button. If you scroll over it, an animation will show like a pink to blue gradient. 

Then we have the products page which is basically the same features as the home page. 

Then we have the about page.
- A cool feature we have here is that a dropdown actually drops down which is INSANE!!!
 
Click the first link "P4 Slackbots". You can see all our links and other epic stuff
- A cool feature we have here is that we used loops to repeat the information and used emojis in here as well.
All this links will go to a different place. 

Now try clicking the names under the about dropdown. Here you can see lots of embedded things that look absolutely amazing! You can actually watch the videos and you can scroll through the documents! You can even use the repl.it website from here!
- The feature of this is really cool because we were able to use embedding to make other websites work inside of this one. 

Now try clicking the projects page. 
- Another feature is that we used the dropdown on this one as well. 
When you click on of these links, it will redirect you to the link you wanted to go to. 

Now click the cart button (This one is best)
First you will see an epic picture of a lock
- Feature: we used icons to add this picture and it looks absolutely amazing! We also used icons for the card images.
You can actaully type in information now!!! It's like a real merch website! 
- We used POST here and this is probably our best feature. You can actually type in information and it will save it. 
As you scroll down you will notice that there is a little checkbox here. If you uncheck it, then you will see billing information drop down. 
- This is absolutely amazing because we actually used JavaScript to make this happen.
Once you fill in all of the things, you can click place order now. 
You will be redirected to another page that will actually show your information!!!
- The epicness of this was that we used variables to save their information and display it back to them. 

We had a lot of features overall and we made some epic stuff in the entire project. 

# TODOS


In regards to putting the code together,
We used flask and jinja to connect the different pages and extend the html.
