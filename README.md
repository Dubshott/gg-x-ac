#P4 Slackbots Merchandise Store

The APCO x GG merch website was designed to display a variety of different clothing. 
Our goal with this is to create a well put together ecommerce website that looks 
very appealing and welcoming. We will back this up by creating our own clothing designed
by yours truly. The website will have different sizes and colors to choose from. 

Future things we want to add to the website is add more types of items availible. 
Things like hats, beanies, pants, etc...

In regards to putting the code together,
We used flask and jinja to connect the different pages and extend the html.


Reflections:

Abhijay: This week I wrote a ton of CSS and learned more properties. I also spent some time making more CSS effects on the website and made those work.

I want to start working on more CSS properties and including them into the merch website. I also want to try and create the merch for the Godly Goats tab and start making more cool things into that. 


Kevin Do: This week we started to finalize the basic layout of how our website will work. We created images of the merchandise and uploaded them to the site and github. I worked with Paul in creating templates for different pages in the site; I worked more on the front end with help from Paul and he led in the backend Python. 

Travis Medley: This week we all worked together in order to finish our merchandise website. We split the work to make the website with gradient bars which id, images of the merch being sold made by kevin and the descriptions for each product that I wrote. In my personal portfolio website I changed some stuff to integrate that gradient bars learned from my group into my own to make it look better and more consumer ready. This week I think I deserve a 19/20 because I worked hard to help with the website but I do think I get 1 point off because I feel I could have done a little more with it. But I am still proud of what I learned this week and with my overall performance.

Gavin Theriault: This week we were just working on our Merch Website. I know it looks like I’m not putting in much effort, but I’m trying my best. I came into this class not knowing anything, so I’m trying to teach myself EVERYTHING in this class because no else can. So it’s hard to participate a lot when the class is moving fast and I have to teach myself everything and try to add to the project with the beginner knowledge I have. So it looks like I’m not adding value or putting in effort, but when I have to spend hours outside of school trying to learn stuff just so that I can actually do something… I don’t think anyone can really judge the work I’m putting in when they don’t see what I do outside of school. They judge me based on my contributions to the project, but its hard to help A LOT when I’m over here having to catch up to everyone else's knowledge. 

Paul Bokelman: From the HTML that I received from Kevin, Abhijay, and I incorporated Flask, Python and more HTML. Basically from the base project I converted all of the files, made a virtual env and made it compatible with flask using all new paths. Now all the HTML and CSS works the python incorporated. On top of adding flask and the venv (to make it compatible with other text editors) to the project I was also attempting to learn MySQL and php so that I could have a working cart and checkout page.
